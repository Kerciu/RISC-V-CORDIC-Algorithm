# 🔢 RISC-V CORDIC Algorithm

My implementation of the CORDIC algorithm in RISC-V assembly, a project subject for Computer Architecture Lab, WUT. 📐🖥️

In this project, you'll find the CORDIC algorithm implemented in Python, C, and RISC-V. 🐍💻🔢

## 📚 Project Description

The CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm is used for various computations including trigonometric functions. 🧮

## 🛠️ Implementation Languages

- **Python**: A high-level implementation for easy understanding and validation. 🐍
- **C**: A low-level implementation that provides insights into performance optimization. 💻
- **RISC-V Assembly**: A hardware-oriented implementation to demonstrate how the algorithm operates at the assembly level. 🛠️

## 📁 Project Structure

- `CORDIC-PYTHON/` - Python implementation of the CORDIC algorithm.
- `CORDIC-C/` - C implementation of the CORDIC algorithm.
- `CORDIC-ASM/` - RISC-V assembly implementation of the CORDIC algorithm.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Python Implementation**:
   - Navigate to the `python/` directory and run:
     ```bash
     python cordic.py
     ```

2. **C Implementation**:
   - Navigate to the `c/` directory and compile the code:
     ```bash
     gcc -o CORDIC CORDIC.c
     ```
   - Run the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./CORDIC
     ```

3. **RISC-V Assembly Implementation**:
   - Navigate to the `CORDIC-ASM/` directory and assemble the code.

## 📝 Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary compilers and tools installed for Python, C, and RISC-V assembly.
- For RISC-V, you might need an emulator (like "RARS" simulator) or hardware that supports RISC-V instructions.
